# Stock-analysis

## Overview of the Project

Steve, our Finance graduate, noticed that stock: DQ's yearly returns were negative and needed a macro built that could run through all the stock data, populate stock trade volume, stock yearly returns, and use that output as a means to advise his parents to consider other stocks. Throughout the project, we defined the stock tickers array, created a loop, a nested loop, and conditionals to run through each cell, formatted the worksheet to display the information neatly, and conditioned the output to color code positive and negative returns. After several enhacements to our code, which included reducing lines of code by creating a loop to initialize the ticker volume array to zero, and xxxxxx, we saw a considerably improvement in how quickly the script executed.

## Results

The results from the data collected in years 2017 and 2018 are significantly different. In 2017, eleven of the twelve stocks saw positive returns compared to 2018 where only two stocks experienced positive returns.
